# jogl-JW-project Computer graphics class Project

This project is about learning how to use OpenGL. It is written in Java using "Java OpenGL" from JoGAmp project https://jogamp.org/ <br />
Currently program is emulating 3D environment, displaying a Kdron https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-dron and allowing you to rotate object, zooming in / out as well as switching matrices from Perspective Projection to Orthogonal Projection.

## Status

jogl-JW-project Computer graphics class Project will be continued on LWJGL https://www.lwjgl.org/#learn-more or Ardor3D (JogAmp continuation).


### Requirements

Project requirements are Java 8+, IDE like Eclipse or InteliJ, configured Maven for dependency management and OpenGL 4.x capable GPU.

### Running Application

To run the app, you simply have to import the project into your IDE and then launch it ("Run" button in Eclipse IDE).
Kdron Controls are following:
```
Arrow keys manipulate  different axsises
Home - switch to Perspective Projection
End - switch to Orthogonal Projection
PageUp - zoom in
PageDown - zoom out
```
